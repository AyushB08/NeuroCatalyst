                   <h2>The Neurology behind the Parkinson's Disease: A-Synucleinopathy and Dopamine Dysfunction</h2>
                   <h4>Author : Sahasra Bathula</h4>
                   <p>Parkinson’s disease also known as a-synucleinopathy, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease (destruction of specific nerve cells). Parkinson's restricts patient movement rendering them incapacitated during many periods throughout the day. This causes symptoms to get worse over time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Parkinson’s disease. A protein called a-synuclein which is a water-soluble protein that lacks a three-dimensional structure, becomes an mis fold. This specific protein aggregates (meaning multiple things combining into one whole thing). These aggregations are also known as Lewy bodies. These Lewy bodies are laid down which causes nerve cells to damage and die. This happens to specific areas in the brain and body. This causes Parkinson’s disease to form. The most affected area of the brain is the substantia nigra. This is an area deep inside the brain which has a high percentage of dopamine nerve cells. This area is also crucial for dopamine production. Dopamine is a compound in the human body. It is a neurotransmitter. This causes dopamine to interfere with signaling. This changes a person’s movement and balance leading to Parkinson’s disease.</p>

                  <h2>Understanding the Stages of Parkinson’s disease</h2>
                  <h4>Author : Sahasra Bathula</h4>
                  <p>Parkinson’s disease also known a-synucleinopathy, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. There are five stages of Parkinson’s disease. Stage 1 and 2 are the early stages. Stage 2 and 3 are the mid-stages, and Stage 4 and 5 are the advanced stages. </p>
                  <p>In stage 1, the person has mild symptoms that never really interfere with their daily activities. In this stage, there might be changes in posture, walking and facial expressions. </p>
                  <p>In stage 2, the symptoms start getting worse. Movement symptoms can affect a person on both sides of the body and also the neck. The person will have problems with walking and they will have poor posture. Doing daily tasks are more difficult and lengthier. </p>
                  <p>In stage 3, people could experience a loss of balance and falls are way more common. Motor symptoms get worse. It’s really hard for a person to do their daily tasks now. However, they are still capable of living an independent life. </p>
                  <p>In stage 4, symptoms are fully developed. The person is still able to walk and stand without any assistance. However, they might a cane or walking stick to be safe. This person also needs help to complete daily tasks and are unable to live alone. </p>
                  <p>In stage 5, the stiffness in a persons leg makes it impossible to stand or walk. The person needs a wheelchair to roam around and they need someone to help them with every activity they do. </p>
                  <p>Those are all of the stages of Parkinson’s disease. As you can see, the symptoms get worse within every stage and it gets more difficult to do everyday tasks.</p>
